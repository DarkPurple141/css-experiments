               <p>What a wonderful year it's been.</p>
               <p>What an unforgettable year it's been.</p>
               <p>Japan. Remember that!</p>
            </span>

            <p>God that feels like a while back. We skiied,
               we ate we onsen'd. But that was just <em>February.</em></p>
            <p>G + Ts were drank and ...</p>
            <p>You persevered to knock off a major piece of policy work.</p>
            <p>You distinguished yourself and completed your masters among
               the top of your class (with some lebanese flair).</p>
            <p>You are loved. By so many, and so much. Just think of your 30th!</p>
            <img class="inline-image" style="float: right;" src="30th.jpg" alt="birthday pic"/>
            <p>You made a baby. Well we <em>both</em> did but the pregnancy, the labour,
               the bounceback. You've made it seem so easy. Lachie couldn't be luckier.
               You're going to be a brilliant mum too.</p>
            <p>...and you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
               even passed your driving test</span>.</p>
            <p>I've never felt quite so close to anyone, as I do to you.
               It's been such a pleasure to be but a small part of your journey.
               I excitedly look forward to even more in 2018 and beyond..
            (Maybe by then we'll have a bathroom).</p>
            <p>I can't underline enough how proud
               you should be of the women you are and continue to be.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">With all the love in the world,<br>
               from both your boys, <br>
               now and <br>
               always. <br><br>

               xx
